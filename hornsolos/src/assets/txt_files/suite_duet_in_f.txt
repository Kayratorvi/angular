This piece, written by Georg Philipp Telemann, is a duet for two natural horns accompanied by piano. 
There isn't much that I'm able to find informationally on this piece, and it isn't well known in the horn community. 
I have played this piece often with friends as it is simple to learn on modern instruments.
