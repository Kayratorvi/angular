Horn-Lokk by Sigurd Berge is the most contemporary piece on this list. Written in 1972, this piece is for solo unaccompanied horn. 
This piece features experimentation with tonal qualities by focusing on unconventional sounds, such as stopped horn and unusual intervals. 
This makes this piece difficult, as there is no accompaniment to fall back on and the soloist must know these unusual intervals by heart. 

<br><br>I meant to play this piece in my senior recital at BYU, but couldn't because of the piece's unrelenting nature. My breathing trouble made it impossible to play without stopping. 
I instead elected to play Intrada for Solo Horn.
<br><br>Total play time: About 7 minutes.
