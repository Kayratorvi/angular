This piece is simply the last movement of Mozart's Horn Quintet, written for string quartet and horn. 
This piece is unique due to its orchestration, and is playful and reminiscient of Mozart's Horn concertos.
<br><br>This was the very first piece I learned at BYU in my undergrad. I played it for my first end-of-semester performance review.
<br><br>Total play time: 6 minutes for the last movement, and about 14 minutes for the whole composition.
