Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Horn Concerto No. 3 in E-flat major, K. 447, was completed between 1784 and 1787, during the Vienna Period.
The composition was written as a friendly gesture for the hornist Joseph Leutgeb (his name is mentioned few times in the score), and Mozart probably did not consider it as particularly important, since he failed to enter it to the autograph catalogue of his works. 
The autograph score remained well preserved; it is stored in the British Library in London.
In addition to the solo horn (in E♭), the concerto is scored for 2 clarinets in B♭ (unlike the oboes used in the other horn concertos), 2 bassoons, and strings. The piece has three movements.
The main melody of the third movement is reminiscent of the theme from the rondo of Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 22 written in 1785.
