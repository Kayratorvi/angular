Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Horn Concerto No. 1 in D major, K. (412+514)/386b was written in 1791. The work is in two movements. 
The concerto is scored for solo horn, two oboes, two bassoons, and strings. 
This is one of two horn concertos of Mozart to include bassoons (the other is K. 447), but in this one he "treats them indifferently in the first movement." 
It is the only one of Mozart's horn concertos to be in D major (the rest are in E-flat major) and the only one to have just two movements instead of the usual three (with the exception of the incompletely scored horn concerto, K. 370b+371).

<br><br>Mozart's autograph score contains, arranged in strategic places throughout the sketch of the Rondo, a bizarre written narrative in Italian almost certainly directed to Leutgeb:
For you, Mr. Donkey—Come on—quick—get on with it—like a good fellow—be brave—Are you finished yet?—for you—beast—oh what a dissonance—Oh!—Woe is me!!—Well done, poor chap—oh, pain in the balls!—Oh God, how fast!—you make me laugh—help—take a breather—go on, go on—that's a little better—still not finished?—you awful swine!—how charming you are!—dear one!—little donkey!—ha, ha, ha—take a breath!—But do play at least one note, you prick!—Aha! Bravo, bravo, hurrah!—You're going to bore me for the fourth time, and thank God it's the last—Oh finish now, I beg of you!—Confound it—also bravura?—Bravo!—oh, a sheep bleating—you're finished?—Thank heavens!—Enough, enough!

<br><br>I learned this piece in my freshman year at BYU.

<br><br>Total play time: About 10 minutes.
