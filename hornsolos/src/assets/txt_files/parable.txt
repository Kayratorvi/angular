Written by American composer, Vincent Persichetti, this piece is one among many pieces he titled "Parable" for a solo instrument. 
He wrote a corresponding Parable for almost every orchestral instrument.
This piece has very wide intervals for the instrument, some spanning over an octave, which is very difficult to play without a glissando on the horn.

<br><br>I played this piece in my junior recital at BYU. It is my favorite unaccompanied horn piece that I have gotten to play thus far.
<br><br>Total play time: About 7 minutes.
