Written by Dutch composer, Otto Ketting, this piece is meant to be played unaccompanied by either a horn or trumpet. 
Interestingly, the piece is not meant to be transposed depending on which instrument is performing it, allowing for two separate interpretations of it with each being in different keys. 
This piece has a very forlorn sound, with an excited fanfare in the middle. To me, it gives the idea of an abandoned kingdom, which at one time was glorious and triumphant, but suffered a mysterious downfall.
<br><br>I played this piece in my senior recital at BYU instead of Horn-Lokk, because this piece uses silence intentionally as part of the performance. 
This gave my lungs a chance to recover after long and unrelenting passages of notes, which is standard for an unaccompanied horn solo.
<br><br>Total play time: About 4 minutes.
