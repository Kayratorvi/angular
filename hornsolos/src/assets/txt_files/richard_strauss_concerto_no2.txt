Richard Strauss composed his Horn Concerto No. 2 in E-flat major, (TrV 283) whilst living in Vienna in 1942. 
The work was premiered in 1943 at the Salzburg Festival and was recorded in 1944, both with solo horn Gottfried von Freiberg. 
The score was published by Boosey & Hawkes of London in 1950. It was taken up and popularised by the British horn player Dennis Brain. 
It has since become the most performed and recorded horn concerto of the 20th century.
The concerto is written in a conservative style that looks back to the musical world of his teenage years as represented by his first horn concerto, which was completed in 1883. 
Strauss follows the typical fast-slow-fast structure of classical concerti, with the three movements in E-flat major, A-flat major, and E-flat major.

<br><br>I originally intended to perform this piece as part of my senior recital at BYU, but due to breathing problems caused by COVID-19, I could not play through the piece without stopping.
I instead elected to play Strauss's first horn concerto instead.

<br><br>Total play time: About 20 minutes.
