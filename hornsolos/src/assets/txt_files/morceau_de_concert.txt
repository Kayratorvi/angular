This piece was written by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille_Saint-Sa%C3%ABns'>Camille Saint-Saens</a>, a French composer who is well known for many of his other compositions. 
This piece, which has three movements with no stops in between, is a technically challenging piece for the horn soloist, demonstrating fast passages and extreme ranges of notes on the horn.
The last movement in particular is exceptionally difficult, and is often left out by younger students of the piece. 
<br><br>I auditioned to BYU with this piece, and left out the third movement. It's still one of my favorite pieces to play of all time, and I revisit it more often than any other piece on this list.
<br><br>Total play time: About 10 minutes.
